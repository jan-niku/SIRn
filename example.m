num_of_steps = 2000; %maximum number of iterations. If all the nodes get recovered before that, the simulation will stop
prob = 0.8; %the probability that the node will be infected from already infected neighboring node
r = 0.3; %the recovery rate
parent_node = [3]; %the ID of the node where infection starts. If parent_node is an array of IDs,
%the infection will start in all of the nodes listed in parent_node. For
%example: parent_node = [1 5 7] means the infection will start in nodes 1 5 and 7 
immunized = []; %the custom probability of virus transmission to certain nodes could be specified if needed.
%For custom transmission probabilities, the vector "immunized" should have the size of number of nodes where
%each entry is the customized probability of transmission to certain node. If left empty, the p is the same
%for all nodes. For example, if network has 5 nodes and we want to
%customize the probabilities of transmission, then immunized vector should
%have the following form: immunized = [0.5 0.5 0.7 0.5 0.9]
